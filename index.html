    <h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
    <p>I am a first-year software engineering student at the Faculty of<br>
      Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, Macedonia, and I  <br>
      am 20 years old. I live in Radishani, a small area outside the city. <br>
      Currently, I don't have a lot of programming experience, but I do<br>
      try to learn on my own, and I'm hoping that one day I'll be able <br>
      to establish a reputation for myself.

    <p>I spend a large deal of my free time playing video games. Some of my<br>
      favorites are Valorant, CS:GO, Skyrim, the Assassin's Creed franchise, <br>
      GTA, and others. Despite the fact that I enjoy playing video games, I <br>
      have always wanted to make my own. For practice, I've tried to recreate <br>
      some of the most well-known traditional games, such as the snake game. <br>
      As a potential profession, I really want to focus more on game development.

    <p>Animals have always had a significant influence on my life ever since I<br>
      was a young child. Growing up, I always wanted to help animals, therefore<br>
      being a veterinarian was my ideal career. Knowing myself, though, I am unable<br>
      to fully explore this dream since I always feel extremely uneasy around injured <br>
      animals. As a result, I strive to assist them in numerous ways. Whenever I come <br>
      across a stray dog or cat, I always feed them and, if possible, provide them with <br>
      shelter until I can locate them a long-term home. I currently own one dog named <br>
      Miroslav who is three years old, as well as two cats named Fox and Lucifer who <br>
      are both nine years old.</p>
